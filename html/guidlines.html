        <h2>Guidlines for the covid 19 vaccination</h2>
        <h3>WHO SHOULD GET VACCINATED</h3>
        <p>
          COVID-19 vaccines with WHO EUL are safe for most people 18 years and
          older, including those with pre-existing conditions, including
          auto-immune disorders. These conditions include: hypertension,
          diabetes, asthma, pulmonary, liver and kidney disease, as well as
          chronic infections that are stable and controlled.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are pregnant, want to get pregnant in the future or are
          currently breastfeeding, getting vaccinated is important to protect
          you and your current or future family. Many people around the world
          have now been vaccinated against COVID-19 while pregnant or
          breastfeeding, and no safety concerns have been identified for them or
          their babies. In fact, getting vaccinated while pregnant helps to
          protect your baby; this may also be the case if you get vaccinated
          while breastfeeding. You should still get vaccinated if you are
          menstruating on the day of your appointment.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are immunocompromised, you should be prioritised for an
          additional dose of COVID-19 vaccine after 1 to 3 months. People with
          compromised immune systems don’t always develop sufficient immunity
          against COVID-19 after one or two doses, so an additional dose can
          help to protect them. You should also get a booster dose if
          recommended.
        </p>
        <p>
          There is growing evidence that children can be safely vaccinated
          against COVID-19. Check the COVID-19 vaccines Q&A page or the
          information pages on each vaccine for advice on what age-specific
          guidance is in place for that vaccine.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are aged 60 and over and are vaccinated with Sinovac or
          Sinopharm, you should be offered a third dose after 3 - 6 months.
          People over 60 have been found to develop less protection after two
          doses of these vaccines than younger people. Getting a third dose can
          help provide higher immunity. You should also get a booster dose when
          it is your turn.
        </p>
        <h3>WHO SHOULD NOT GET VACCINATED</h3>
        <h4>It is safe for most people to get vaccinated against COVID-19.</h4>
        <p>However, you should not be vaccinated if:</p>
        <p>
          You have a history of severe allergic reactions/anaphylaxis to any of
          the ingredients of the COVID-19 vaccine, in order to avoid possible
          adverse effects.
        </p>
        <p>
          You have a fever over 38.5ºC on the day of your vaccine appointment.
          Postpone until you have recovered.
        </p>
        <p>
          You currently have confirmed or suspected COVID-19. Wait until you
          have completed the mandated isolation period and your acute symptoms
          have passed to get vaccinated.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you are on blood thinners, it is safe for you to get vaccinated but
          let the person vaccinating you know.
        </p>
        <h3>WHAT TO EXPECT AFTER GETTING VACCINATED</h3>
        <p>
          Some people will experience mild side effects after being vaccinated
          against COVID-19. Common side effects to COVID-19 vaccines include a
          fever, head or body aches and a sore arm. These symptoms usually go
          away within a day or two. You can manage any side effects with rest,
          plenty of non-alcoholic liquids and taking medication to manage pain
          and fever, if needed. We do not recommend taking medication for pain
          before being vaccinated, as we don’t know how this will affect how
          well the vaccine works.
        </p>
        <p>
          Contact your health care provider if you are worried about any of the
          side effects that you are experiencing. More serious or long-lasting
          side effects to COVID-19 vaccines are extremely rare. If you
          experience difficulty breathing, chest pain, confusion, loss of speech
          or mobility after your vaccine, contact your healthcare provider
          immediately. Vaccines are continually monitored to detect and respond
          to rare adverse events.
        </p>
        <p>
          It takes several weeks after each dose of COVID-19 vaccine for your
          body to develop maximum levels of immunity – you are not protected
          right away. We still don’t know exactly how long protection from
          COVID-19 vaccines lasts, but most people have strong protection
          against serious illness and death for at least 6 months.
        </p>
        <p>
          As WHO understands more about COVID-19 vaccines, we will be updating
          our recommendations accordingly and keeping the information on this
          page updated.
